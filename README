This directory contains the rec-thy package. This package provides a large
number of macros to express standard pieces of notation in recursion theory
aka computability theory. The file rec-thy.pdf (which can be generated from
rec-thy.tex) provides a guide to usage and examples of almost all the macros
and package options as well as release notes.

Comments, feedback and patches welcomes.  

Since my goal is to provide something of use to the community (and myself) I 
see no reason to burden down potential reuse of this material in the future
with the risk of silly license compatibility issues so I'm releasing this
into the public domain.  I would *ask* anyone who reuses it not to be a dick 
about it (give credit, commit upgrades back etc..)
